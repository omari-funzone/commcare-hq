    Management command for rolling back RepeatRecord migration to SQL:

    1. Revert the "ðŸš€" PR that contains the following commits:

       * "ðŸš€ Repeater.register() registers a SQLRepeatRecord"
       * "ðŸš€ Migrate repeat records"
       * "ðŸš€ Call process_repeater() from check_repeaters()"

    2. Execute this management command to unset the RepeatRecord
       "migrated" state. This command can be executed multiple times if
       execution fails due to ResourceConflict errors.


    To try switching to SQL again:

    1. Drop and recreate the SQL tables::

           $ ./manage.py migrate repeaters 0001
           $ ./manage.py migrate repeaters

    2. Redeploy the "ðŸš€" PR.
